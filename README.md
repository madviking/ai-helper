### Ai Helper

This is a simple ai helper to connect with openrouter, google, openai and openrouter. Input and output is always a pydantic model. 

### Activating the environment

Simply run install.sh and then do source venv/bin/activate

#### LLM TASK 
Please implement the full functionality. 

#### Specific implementation considerations
- When loading PydanticModel with results, in most cases invididual fields that don't validate should be just discarded
- We should add information about how many percent of the model fields are filled


#### Guidelines for implementation
- No function should be longer than 200 lines.
- No class should be longer than 700 lines.
- Feel free to create new files to make things more modular.
- Configuration should be kept in pyllm_config.json - extend that when needed. No other config files besides provider specific config files. 
- ALWAYS write tests before implementing. TDD!
- ALWAYS stop for approval after creating the tests. 
- ALWAYS run tests after making changes.
- ALWAYS rely on providers for getting and modifying the LLM's, Configs, and Pydantic models.
- PATHS should always be coming from the utils, never hard coded.
- Use the provided venv information. **Don't install packages or try to modify venv**. Always activate it to run any commands.
- When changing any methods, ALWAYS search for usages elsewhere.
